Overview
In this lab, you will be scanning for hosts on a Local Area Network (LAN). Figure 1 shows the lab topology for this lab. You are using a distribution of Linux called Kali, which is primarily used for penetration testing. You will scan the network with Kali. You will use Metasploit and Armitage to exploit a machine with vulnerabilities.

Outcomes:
In this lab, you will learn to:
